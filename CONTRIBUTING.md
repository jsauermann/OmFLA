Improvement proposals, in particular for improving the OmFLA device or its documentation, are welcome and should be sent by email to: feedback@j√ºrgen-sauermann.de.

Please keep in mind that the different firmware images are already close to the flash memory limit of 4 k-Byte of the Atmel 4313 device, which makes larger code-improvements impossible. For that reason I have to be fairly restrictive when it comes to additional functionality of the device itself.

All other contributions, such as utility programs that run on other machines (e.g. on Raspberry Pis), are welcome. I am not yet familiar with the way of working on github, so please add some advice how to handle your contrinution.
